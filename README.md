#chunkgen

Mod to pre-generate chunks. This is only required on the server.

##Usage

This mod adds the following command to Minecraft:

```
/chunkgen <x> <y> <height> <width> [dimension]
```

where `x` and `y` are the origin chunk coordinates, height and width describe a rectangle centered at x,y of chunks to generate and dimension is the dimension ID to generate the chunks in.

All arguments should be whole numbers, however `x` and `y` may also be `~` which represents the players current position. 

`dimension` is an optional argument.

[1.7.10-1.0](https://github.com/gecgooden/chunkgen/releases/tag/v1.0) is for Minecraft 1.7.10 and Forge-10.13.0.1180+.
